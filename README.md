# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This is a capstone project to predict house prices using Linear Regression. The model is trained on historical house features and prices, and can be used to estimate prices based on inputs like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **IDE:** Google Colab

## 📊 Features Used

- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Square Footage (sqft_living)
- Number of Floors

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE
- R² Score

## 📁 Files

- `housing_price_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete code.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.
